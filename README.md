## polyglot-app-comparison
This project is part of my exploration to see how various languages handle the same application, and it is based off the Lynda.com tutorial "Polyglot Web Development". In this project I use four languages (Node.js, Perl, Python and Ruby) that pull from a MongoDB database filled with quotes from various individuals.  The various server engines provide the  API endpoints that enable the user to perform CRUD actions from the UI.  

## Motivation
As a lifelong learner I was very curious to expand my understanding of programming languages ...(needs work)
